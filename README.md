# gpg --list-keys

All my emails offer end-to-end encryption with GPG, some public keys are listed in [gpg_keys](https://github.com/cdp1337/cdp1337/tree/main/gpg_keys).  I try to use private servers, but generally recommend using GPG/PGP whenever necessary.

# cat /proc/career

I currently work at a large enterprise specializing in information management, digital security, and backups doing Linux systems administration and development in PHP, C#, and Java.  This does not relate to anything here but more information is available on LinkedIn (profile not linked, but a savvy searcher shouldn't have a difficult time).
